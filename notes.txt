Every hour:
  Look for games that ended over a day ago. Delete.

Need a data cleanup phase (1 day?)
V2: Add way to save a 'screenshot'?
What about 'create room' spam?
  Could limit room creation to logged in?
Limit on the size of the image data?
Use push notifications for your turn & game complete
Can easily cache previous 100 pages.
Prevent a user creating too many games.
Make it a PWA
Compression urlencoded body before sending, if compressstream is present
When adding notifications, make sure if the current player is removed, the new current player is notifified
Add prompts to actions that aren't undoable
Proper loading states for everything
How does maxLength work? Make sure the server and JS are in sync with this. Eg, what does an emoji count as?
Wrap clientside requests in try/catch so they don't break in poor connectivity.
Are all refs automatically set to null when parent component unmounts?
Pointer tracker needs a 'remove listeners' method.
If the pointer doesn't move, no line is created
It's possible for -1 to appear during drawing. Max it with 0.
  Same goes for neg 16 values
Hunt down TODOs and console logs
When JS enhances a form, use the form action rather than recreating it
  Maybe create a helper for this? It's pretty repetitive
PointerTracker needs a way to release listeners
Compress image turn upload data?
Reset scroll on dynamic page change.
Trim image on submission? Add a padding.

Next step:
  On the "draw it" screen:
    It appears too long on desktop. Its size should be limited.
      Maybe redo the CSS here. It's really hacky.
